# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

The application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

These are standard approaches to maintaining code quality, ensuring consistency, and automatically deploying the latest code once it passes all checks and is merged into the main branch.
